#  Escape Rooms 

Welcome to the thrilling world of JavaScript Escape Rooms! 🎉 This guide is your treasure map for cracking the puzzles using JavaScript magic. Let's get started!

## Room 1: Finding the Key

Imagine you're in a mysterious room. Your mission? Find the hidden key that unlocks the next adventure. Click the "Solve Room 1" button (it's like pushing a secret button on the wall). But wait! Be super careful—choose the right button! Once you click it, read the message that pops up. It's like deciphering ancient runes.



## Room 2: Unlocking the Door

Now you're in Room 2. The door is locked, and you need the magic code to open it. Click the "Solve Room 2" button (it's like turning a mysterious knob). Read the message carefully—it holds the secret code to unlock the door. 🗝️



## Room 3: Navigating the Labyrinth

Welcome to Room 3—a twisty-turny labyrinth awaits! Your quest: navigate through it successfully. Click the "Solve Room 3" button (it's like stepping on a hidden switch). Follow the directions carefully. If you conquer the maze, a magical message will appear. 🌟



## Helpful Spells (Functions)

Here are some spells—I mean, functions—used in the JavaScript code:

- `findMostRecentBook(books)`: It's like a crystal ball that finds the latest book.
- `findIntersection(setA, setB)`: Imagine it as a potion that reveals the common elements between two sets.
- `navigateLabyrinth(directions)`: This one's tricky—it guides you through the labyrinth, but it's a bit slow (like a sleepy dragon).

## Conclusion

You've mastered the basics of Vanilla JavaScript! 🎓 Now, get ready to level up. Next stop: React! It's like learning a new spellbook to build magical web apps.

Happy coding and may your escape be epic! 🚀✨
